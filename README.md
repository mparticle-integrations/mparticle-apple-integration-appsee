The Appsee integration for the mParticle iOS SDK has been deprecated and is no longer supported. To find an alternative integration, visit [mParticle Integrations](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/).

**Deprecated**

This repository contains the [Appsee](https://www.appsee.com) integration for the [mParticle Apple SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk).

### Adding the integration

1. Add the kit dependency to your app's Podfile:

    ```
    pod 'mParticle-Appsee', '~> 7.0'
    ```

2. Follow the mParticle iOS SDK [quick-start](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk), then rebuild and launch your app, and verify that you see `"Included kits: { Appsee }"` in your Xcode console 

> (This requires your mParticle log level to be at least Debug)

3. Reference mParticle's integration docs below to enable the integration.
